# Architecture

Droid Control is split into three runtime surfaces: the React renderer, the Electron host, and the Node sidecar.

## Runtime flow

  User[User] --> Renderer[React renderer]
  Renderer --> Preload[Electron preload API]
  Preload --> Main[Electron main process]
  Main --> Sidecar[Node sidecar WebSocket bridge]
  Sidecar --> DroidSDK[Factory Droid SDK]
  Sidecar --> DroidCLI[Droid CLI child processes]
  Main --> Updater[Download and update endpoints]
```

## Components

| Area | Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Renderer | `src/` | React UI, local state, settings, onboarding, session and Mission Control views |
| Electron main | `electron/main.cjs` | Window lifecycle, bridge process management, native browser lifecycle, downloads, update checks |
| Electron preload | `electron/preload.cjs` | Narrow API boundary between renderer and Electron main process |
| Native browser preload | `electron/nativeBrowserPreload.cjs` | Browser automation bridge for embedded native browser flows |
| Sidecar | `sidecar/src/` | Local WebSocket bridge, Droid SDK session lifecycle, Mission Control integration, CLI discovery |

## Data and control boundaries

- The renderer does not call the Droid SDK directly. It communicates through preload APIs and the sidecar bridge.
- The Electron main process owns local process lifecycle and injects bridge configuration into the sidecar.
- The sidecar owns Droid SDK calls and child process environment shaping. It removes `FACTORY_API_KEY` unless a key is explicitly configured.
- Packaged builds require a bridge token. Development builds may allow local no-token access with `BRIDGE_ALLOW_LOCAL_NO_TOKEN=1`.

### Sidecar session core

- `appSessionId` is the stable top-level application identity. `childSessionId` is the stable logical child identity within its `parentAppSessionId`; `providerSessionId` is reserved for the backing Factory session.
- `SessionManager` is the composition root and public command coordinator. It retains public dispatch, cross-module routing, and shutdown ordering.
- `FactoryRuntime` is the narrow SDK seam; `DroidRuntime` is its production adapter.
- `SessionRegistry` owns top-level sessions only: the live parent map, stable application identity, provider aliases, canonical parent summary persistence, and projected summary reads. Children never enter `SessionRegistry` or `sessions.list`.
- `ChildSessions` is the one stateful generic owner of parent-child membership, canonical child identity, provider replacement, admission, capacity, queues, turns, settings, cleanup, exact context/compaction targets, and child persistence/hydration.
- `MissionControlPolicy` owns only AGI Mission Control policy and projection: features, progress, worker/validator decisions, spawn correlation, Mission phase, and Mission completion. It may call `ChildSessions`; `ChildSessions` does not import Mission Control.
- `SessionTimeline` owns history listing and restore, child replay, status entries, and the canonical record-before-emit path for live transcript events.
- `SessionContext` owns context snapshots, polling, compaction generations, and usage carryover. Parent and child targets remain isolated by `appSessionId` or the exact `parentAppSessionId + childSessionId` pair.
- `SessionCompaction` owns compaction-limit policy, provider arming, automatic notification transitions and watchdogs, and live or historical manual compaction. Child automatic settlements validate the captured parent, runtime, turn, and configuration generations before publishing or mutating state.
- `SessionInteractions` owns permission and question correlation, equivalent-signature grants, and the Spec-to-Auto transition. After successful Registry unregister, Lifecycle calls `forgetSession()`, which discards module-owned state without resolving callbacks or emitting events. PR 4 introduces no deterministic shutdown settlement; that behavior remains deferred.
- `SessionEventFlow` owns stream and notification normalization, per-app/per-source terminal gating, and transcript-before-side-effect ordering. It has one callback into Manager for the coupled policy that remains there.
- `SessionLifecycle` owns primary-session create, resume, lazy resume, send queueing, steering, interruption, and ordered cleanup. Parent close calls one semantic `ChildSessions.closeParent()` operation rather than maintaining another child map.

### Renderer child navigation

- The left navigation and `sessions.list` contain parent sessions only.
- The active parent's canonical child summaries appear in the right context panel, including historical and same-role siblings.
- Selection, readiness, transcript filtering, settings, send, steer, Stop, and interrupt all resolve through one visible target keyed by `parentAppSessionId + childSessionId`.
- A provider runtime identity is never stored as a renderer child key. Historical or unavailable children remain selectable for transcript review while mutating actions stay disabled.

### Autonomy

- The canonical levels are `off`, `low`, `medium`, and `high`, shared verbatim by the renderer, the bridge protocol, and the sidecar.
- Every `session.create` carries an explicit autonomy snapshot. The sidecar fails fast when it is missing instead of falling back to provider or factory defaults.
- The application default (Medium on first run) is persisted by the renderer and edited only in Settings → Configuration. The composer drafts a per-session override from that default; the draft resets whenever the create target changes.
- Starting a Mission requires High autonomy. The composer blocks a lower draft behind an explicit choice to raise it; autonomy is never elevated silently.
- Live changes go provider-first through `session.updateSettings`, serialized per session. The renderer shows a pending state and settles only when the confirmed summary arrives; rejections surface as recoverable `session.autonomy_update_failed` errors, and a settlement that lands after close or provider replacement is discarded.
- Child sessions report their confirmed effective autonomy only while their runtime is live. It is read from the provider init result, never persisted, and never inherited from the parent; historical or unopened children report none and the renderer labels them provider managed.

## Build path

`npm run build` runs frontend typecheck and Vite build, builds the sidecar bundle, and syntax-checks Electron CommonJS entrypoints. The sidecar build emits `sidecar/dist/sidecar.mjs`, which Electron uses unless `SIDECAR_ENTRY` is set.

## Update path

Electron checks update metadata through `DROID_UPDATE_FEED` when configured. CLI downloads default to `DROID_DOWNLOAD_BASE=https://droidex.app`, with optional host allow-listing through `DROID_UPDATE_HOSTS`.
